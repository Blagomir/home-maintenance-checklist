## What is this?

The main idea of this checklist is to gather as much information as possible about home maintenance that every homeowner need to do all year round.

The main points are divided by months. Where appropriate, a day of the month is set as a recommendation.

This list is gathered by personal experience but I will be happy if more and more people contribute with ideas.

Feel free to raise pull request with your changes to the checklist.
